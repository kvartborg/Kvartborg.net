        I worked for Uptime as a Software Developer from 2014 - 2017.<br />
        At Uptime i were involved in a lot of different projects through the years.
        This includes webshops, progressive web applications based on React/Preact or Vue.js,
        and embedded development for the Rasperry pi. Here is a list of some of
        the projects i worked on: Bridge Walking Lilleb√¶lt, Screenify, EcoGrid, Vision Field Care, UpSub,
        internal Dashboard for monitoring and other internal stuff.
