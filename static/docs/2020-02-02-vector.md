It is important to emphasis that this is an experiment, there are lots of other libraries tackling vector math as well. You should properly take a look at [`gonum`](https://github.com/gonum/gonum) before consider using any of the code presented in this article.

The intend of this package is not to replace gonum in any way. Its an alternative way to handle vectors and vector arithmetic, which strives to have a concise api that reduces the overall
verbosity and thereby increase the readability of math expressions in Go.

This project contains internal code from the gonum project which enhances the performance of the following arithmetic operations: `addition`, `subtraction` and `scaling`. If you haven't already, give gonum a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/gonum/gonum) for the incredible work they are doing.

This article will only focus on the semantic of handling vectors and vector arithmetic in Go.
I will properly write a follow up that compare performance, memory usage and other tradeoffs of
implementations tackling vector math.

### Why?
To answer why i have started this experiment in the first place, we first have to
define what a vector is.

> A vector is given by $$ n $$ coordinates and can be specified as $$ (A_1, A_2, ..., A_n) $$
  Vectors are sometimes referred to by the number of coordinates they have,
  so a 2-dimensional vector $$ (x_1,x_2) $$ is often called a two-vector,
  an $$ n $$-dimensional vector is often called an $$ n $$-vector. <br>
  \- [Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Vector.html)

The naiv way that a vector could be represent in Go is by defining a struct type as
`Vector2D`. This vector represents a two-vector as defined by Wolfram.

```go
type Vector2D struct {
    x, y float64
}
```

This approach is very naiv and will not scale well because
the implementation have to change with different dimensions of vectors.
This is not feasable and in many cases will result redundant code supporting
vectors of different dimensions.

But it actually has an appealing use case, and thats related to performance.
Because the vector type is well defined, it can do arithmetic operations very fast
compared to other implementations. This is the reason why the solution
used at DanaDynamics as of this writing is based on a 3-dimensional vector type,
with the above mentioned limitations.

Those limitations are ultimatively what triggered the experiment,
there must be a solution that is still performant and syntactically close to
the existing solution used at DanaDynamics.

### Gonum to the rescue
Gonum is a great library that includes many useful numeric libraries, and in
most cases performs very well. But in the case of arithmetic operations on smaller
matrices or vectors it really isn't that fast (maybe its just me using it wrongly?).
Another drawback is that the usage of gonum can get very verbose real fast.
As can be seen in the simple example provided below.

$$ result = (1, 2, 3) + (3, 2, 1) $$

```go
// Create a receiving vector
result := mat.NewVecDense(3, nil)

// Create two new 3-dimensional vectors: (1,2,3), (3,2,1)
v1 := mat.NewVecDense(3, []float64{1, 2 ,3})
v2 := mat.NewVecDense(3, []float64{3, 2 ,1})

// result = (1,2,3) + (3,2,1)
result.AddVec(v1, v2)
```

I really like the idea behind gonum and support all the work that gets put into it.
But for the use case i'm after this is just way to much code to write to
achieve something as simple as the above example. And it just doesn't perform
good enough with smaller dimension vectors for the use cases we have at
DanaDynamics currently.

Compatebility

### The alternative approach

```go
type Vector []float64
```

### Tackling verbosity
Another goal of this experiment is to minimize the verbosity around using the package,
this can be acheived by using type aliasing. In this way you can omit the package
identifier and give the `Vector` a shorter name like `vec` or something else,
it is up to you.
```go
// Minimize the verbosity by using type aliasing
type vec = vector.Vector

// addition of two vectors
result := vec{1, 2}.Add(vec{2, 4})
```

A nice side effect of representing a vector as a list of `float64` values is that
we easily can turn a slice of `float64` into a vector by using type casting.
This elimitates the need for any constructor functions for the vector type.
```go
// Turn a list of floats into a vector
v := vec([]float64{1, 2, 3})
```

```go
// Turn a vec into a gonum VecDense
v := vec{1, 2}
gv := mat.NewVecDense(len(v), v)
```

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  \vec{w}_1, \vec{w}_2, \dots, \vec{w}_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\vec{r} = \vec{w}_1 + \vec{w}_2 + \dots + \vec{w}_n
$$

$$
\theta = \mathrm{atan2}(\vec{r}_2, \vec{r}_1)
$$

$$
v = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \begin{Vmatrix} \vec{w}_i \end{Vmatrix}} {n}

$$

$$ \vec{aw} $$ is the calculated avarage wind

```go
func AverageWind(winds []*mat.VecDense) *mat.VecDense {
    // Find average direction of winds
    r := mat.NewVecDense(2, nil)
    for i := range winds {
        r.AddVec(r, winds[i])
    }
    direction := math.Atan2(r.AtVec(1), r.AtVec(0))

    // Find average speed of winds
    var speed float64
    for i := range winds {
        speed += mat.Norm(winds[i], 2)
    }
    speed /= len(winds)

    // Create vector with average speed and rotate it in
    // the average direction
    s := mat.NewVecDense(2, []float64{speed, 0})
    cos, sin := math.Cos(direction), math.Sin(direction)

    return mat.NewVecDense(2, []float64{
        cos*s.AtVec(0) - sin*s.AtVec(1),
        sin*s.AtVec(0) + cos*s.AtVec(1),
    })
}
```

```go
func AverageWind(winds []vec) vec {
    // Find average speed of winds
    r := make(vec, 2).Add(winds...)
    direction := math.Atan2(r[1], r[0])

    // Find average speed of winds
    var speed float64
    for i := range winds {
        speed += winds[i].Magnitude()
    }
    speed /= len(winds)

    // Create vector with average speed and rotate it in
    // the average direction
    return vec{speed}.Rotate(direction)
}
```

### Conclusion


### Contribution
It is based on my own experience working with vector math in Go projects at DanaDynamics, and therefore the focus has been on operations that we use. Contributions with common operations that aren't included in this package yet are very welcome. So is comments/suggestions in the form of issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/kvartborg/vector).

### Credits
Thanks to [`gonum`](https://github.com/gonum/gonum) for inspiration and the following functions [`axpyUnitaryTo`](https://github.com/gonum/gonum/blob/master/internal/asm/f64/axpyunitaryto_amd64.s), [`scalUnitaryTo`](https://github.com/gonum/gonum/blob/c3867503e73e5c3fee7ab93e3c2c562eb2be8178/internal/asm/f64/scalunitaryto_amd64.s) that enhances the performance of arithmetic operations in this package.

Thanks to [@buggaarde](https://github.com/buggaarde), for input on this subject and for the implementation used at DanaDynamics at the time of this writing, its performance can properly not be beaten by an $$ n $$-dimensional approach, but we can get closer.
